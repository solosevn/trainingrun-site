  "narrative_brief": "**Morning Briefing**\n\nAs we start the day, here are two key AI stories that caught our attention:\n\n**1. Agents | Truth: 52/100**\nA new open-source chatbot framework called Hermes-Agent has been released on GitHub by NousResearch. This framework allows AI chatbots to interact with datasets from France's national Open Data platform using a conversational interface. The project is hosted on the official data.gouv.fr Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.\n\nWhy it matters: This development could enable more efficient and user-friendly access to large datasets, which is crucial for training and testing AI models. It also highlights the growing importance of open-source frameworks in the AI ecosystem. Cross-confirmed by GitHub repository.\n\n**2. Open vs Closed | Truth: 50/100**\nA collection of LLM (Large Language Model) apps has been compiled on GitHub by Shubhamsaboo, featuring various AI agents and RAG (Reinforced Actor-Gritic) models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and open-source alternatives. The repository showcases the diversity of LLM applications and models available.\n\nWhy it matters: This collection demonstrates the growing adoption of LLMs in various industries and highlights the increasing importance of open-source models in AI development. It also underscores the need for more transparency and standardization in model selection and deployment. Note that this is a curated list, not an exhaustive benchmarking effort.",
